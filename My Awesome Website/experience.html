        <h2>Print Production Manager</h2>
        <h4><em>Vision Stream Inc.</em></h4>
        <p>I spent 6 years as a print production manager for Vision Stream Inc.</p>
        <p>While working there in large format graphic production I was able to develop solid project management skills, and also worked closely with customer's design teams to deliver award winning custom tradeshow graphics. I look forward to using the creative skills that were developed there in my new career of web development.</p>

        <h2>National Account Manager</h2>
        <h4><em><a href="https://www.nrfsinc.com/">National Retail Flooring Services</a></em></h4>
        <p>After years of project management under my belt I made a change and spent the next 6 years with National Retail Flooring Services.</p>
        <p>With NRFS I spent years managing commercial flooring projects in a retail settings across the United States. During my time I spearheaded countless, time sensitive projects. While facilitating projects, I also worked direct with customers to develop more business and deliver a high level of customer service.   </p>

        <h2>Home Mortgage Consultant</h2>
        <h4><em>Wells Fargo Bank N.A.</em></h4>
        <p>In April of 2019 I moved across the country and unfortunately my time with NRFS had to come to an end. I was very successful working with customers and developing more business.   </p>
        <p>With the numbers to show the success, I took a new role as a mortgage consultant with Wells Fargo Bank. While my stint in this position was short, it was not due to lack of sucess or promise. I quickly was top of my team and producing at a high level.</p>
        <p>I was not getting everything from the job that I needed though. After lots of debate, I made the decision to leave my position and pursue a new career in web development. I look forward to the challenge to get a career that provides the fulfillment I am after!  </p>
